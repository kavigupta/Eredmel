The purpose of the Eredmel Project is to design a programming preprocessor (The
Eredmel Preprocessor) and language (Eredmel) that will allow for ultimate
customizability of programs. To this end, the language is being designed to
allow almost all built in features to be replicated and disabled by the end
user within the language. For example, operators such as (+), (-), and even (=)
are defined in Eredmel itself, not in the Java interpreter.

Eredmel is interpreted in Java because the Enhanced Regular Expression library
is programmed in Java, as well as for reasons of multi-platform usability.

The Eredmel Projects are a work in process. Many of the classes require more
documentation or may be renamed / refactored / deleted at some point in the
future.
